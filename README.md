# Sale Prediction for Food Items: A Data Science Project
This data science project focuses on developing a robust and accurate model for predicting sales of food items. By leveraging historical sales data, item characteristics, and potentially external factors, the project aims to provide valuable insights for businesses in the food industry.
Following the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, this project has generated insightful visualizations to understand the underlying patterns in food item sales.

## The EDA process involved:

### Data Cleaning: 
  Addressing missing values, remove duplicates , and ensuring data consistency across various features.
### Visual Exploration: 
  Creating a range of plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmap) to examine the distribution of sales, relationships between variables, and temporal 
  trends.

## Key observations from the visualizations include:
- Sales Distribution: Understanding the spread and central tendency of sales figures across different food items and time periods.
- Feature Relationships: Identifying potential correlations between item characteristics (e.g., category, MRP, outlet size) and sales performance.
- Outlier Identification: Visualizing extreme sales values that might require further investigation or specific handling during the modeling phase.
These visual insights form a strong foundation for the subsequent steps in the project, particularly feature engineering and model selection. The observed patterns and relationships will guide the creation of relevant features and the choice of appropriate predictive models to accurately forecast food item sales.
